# Journey blog app
This app is a christmas gift to my brother :christmas_tree:
On January, he and his finacea :couplekiss: are gonna travel around the world for 6 month :earth_africa:

So I want to offer them a closed mobile platform :closed_lock_with_key: :iphone: where they can easily share their trip with friends and family.

### :metal: The challenge
The app has to be as fun to use for their geeky pals as it is easy for grandma! :exploding_head:
